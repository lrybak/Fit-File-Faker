# ruff: noqa: E402
"""Main application module for Fit File Faker.

This module provides the command-line interface and core application logic
for modifying FIT files and uploading them to Garmin Connect. It simulates
a Garmin Edge 830 device to enable Training Effect calculations for activities
from non-Garmin sources.

The module includes:

- CLI argument parsing and validation
- FIT file upload to Garmin Connect with OAuth authentication
- Batch processing of multiple FIT files
- Directory monitoring for automatic processing of new files
- Rich console output with colored logs

Typical usage:

    $ fit-file-faker -s                    # Initial setup
    $ fit-file-faker activity.fit          # Edit single file
    $ fit-file-faker -u activity.fit       # Edit and upload
    $ fit-file-faker -ua                   # Upload all new files
    $ fit-file-faker -m                    # Monitor directory
